# New Year's Active Day Activity ideas


Morning, 10:00 to 12:30
-> Robot competition: 
two competing teams try to build a robot
that can move a box with markers on (we don't have a flag yet)
DONE - there are rules, markers printed, kit was tested

-> building Flags: 
A team assembles the flags needed for the competition, so they can go out to TechDays.
NOT - lasercutting abilities were not achieved yet

-> make document to get new volunteers interested:
DONE - tomleese will lead the group

Lunch, 12:30 to 1:30 
shared pizza and a salad curtesy of lilafisch
NEEDS: lilafisch to buy, cook veg on Friday, bring tools to move, consume salad

Quiz, 1:30 to 2:30
NEEDS: quiz slides (tomleese is working on that)

Coffe&bisquits
NEEDS: kettle, plastic cups, sweets, instant coffee, tea, something to stir, milk, sugar
this could be combined with project introduction, if people want this.

Afternoon, 2:45 to ~ 6:30pm
-> continue of robot competition
-> srobo web things - NOT (unless someone volunteers for it)
-> srobo tool things - NOT (unless someone volunteers for it)
-> arena build planning - NOT, rob is not coming
-> toto testing - can it be used for kickstart? can it be used for teaching new blueshirts??
NEEDS: test my toto account, discuss it with toto developer


Evening: The Crown 6:30 to 8:30

The evening (from ca. 9) would end in a round of artemis, the bridge simulator.

====== Project introduction?
People who are actively working on a project atm/who have tickets that need doing can introduce
them here and try to get volunteers to get in touch with them??

====== not so good ideas
test kickstart micro games, do the micro game where blueshirts simulate robots in the common.
