# New Year's Active Day Activity ideas


Morning, 9:30 to 12:30
-> Robot competition: 
two competing teams try to build a robot
that can move a box with markers on (we don't have a flag yet)
NEEDS: missing bits for Southampton test kit

-> building Flags: 
A team assembles the flags needed for the competition, so they can go out to TechDays.
NEEDS: lasercutting of parts, purchase of parts.

-> make document to get new volunteers interested:
NEEDS: TomL.

-> toto testing - can it be used for kickstart? can it be used for teaching new blueshirts??
NEEDS: test my toto account, discuss it with toto developer


Lunch, 12:30 to 1:30 
shared pizza and a salad curtesy of lilafisch
NEEDS: more people to bring salad?, lilafisch to buy, cook veg on Friday, bring tools to move, consume salad

Quiz, 1:30 to 2:30
NEEDS: quiz slides (TOM), preparation of challenges that use kit (VOLUNTEERS TO PREPARE)

Coffe&bisquits
NEEDS: kettle, plastic cups, sweets, instant coffee, tea, something to stir, milk, sugar
this could be combined with project introduction, if people want this.

Afternoon, 2:45 to ~ 7pm
-> continue of robot competition
-> srobo web things
-> srobo tool things
-> arena build planning

Evening: The Crown or make your own sandwiches (we provide toast, meaty and veg sandwich fillings)

The evening would end in a round of artemis, the bridge simulator.

====== Project introduction?
People who are actively working on a project atm/who have tickets that need doing can introduce
them here and try to get volunteers to get in touch with them??

====== not so good ideas
test kickstart micro games, do the micro game where blueshirts simulate robots in the common.
