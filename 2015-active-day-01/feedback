Feedback from active day:
Results:
- It was really good to connect some faces to other blueshirts and be active together!
- Tudors are now on new dev kit
- Start on mentor handbook was made
- Learned a lot about the new kit and the game

Improvements:
- More time to have a conversation instead of activities
  -> tea time was planned but not implemented, since people were too focused on competition
- Check there is no football etc. keeping us out of pub
- Pub on campus is more practical for people who need to get to public transport/a bus
- Check options for earlier pub time, so people who have a trip home can come
- Check for relevant railway engineering works that could prevent people staying as late as they want
